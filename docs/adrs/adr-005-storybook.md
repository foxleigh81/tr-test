# ADR 005: Use Storybook for component development and documentation

- **Date created**: 28/06/2025
- **Driver**: Alex Foxleigh (Foxy)

## Status

![accepted]

## Context

While Storybook might be considered over-engineering for an application of this size, the project was specified to be built as
if it were a product designed to scale. As a strong proponent of Storybook-driven development, implementing it from the
beginning provides several key advantages:

- **Component isolation:** Develop and test components in isolation from the main application
- **Living documentation:** Automatically generated documentation that stays in sync with code
- **Design system development:** Build and maintain a consistent component library
- **Testing capabilities:** Visual regression testing and interaction testing
- **Collaboration:** Non-technical stakeholders can review and provide feedback on components
- **Quality assurance:** Catch edge cases and different states during development

Storybook-driven development encourages:

- Better component design and reusability
- Comprehensive coverage of component states and variations
- Earlier detection of accessibility and usability issues
- Cleaner separation of concerns between components and application logic

## Discussions

- Alex Foxleigh - Even though this is a smaller application, building with scalability in mind means establishing good
patterns early. Storybook-driven development results in better component architecture and more maintainable code.

## Decision

Implement Storybook for component development, documentation, and testing.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Forces better component design and reusability
- Provides living documentation for components
- Enables component-driven development workflow
- Facilitates collaboration between developers and designers
- Supports visual regression testing
- Improves component quality through isolated development
- Establishes scalable patterns for future growth

**Negative:**

- Additional setup and configuration overhead
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Storybook
- Extra maintenance overhead for keeping stories up to date
- May seem like over-engineering for smaller applications
- Additional build and deployment considerations
