# API Development Plan: Olympic Medals Dashboard

## Objective

Build a high-performance, strongly-typed API layer for the Olympic medals dashboard that serves medal data efficiently 
with built-in sorting capabilities and robust race condition handling.

## Data Analysis

Based on the provided `/src/data/medals.json` data structure:

```typescript
interface MedalCountry {
  code: string;        // ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes (USA, NOR, RUS, etc.)
  gold: number;        // Gold medal count
  silver: number;      // Silver medal count  
  bronze: number;      // Bronze medal count
}
```

**Data Characteristics:**

- 13 countries in current dataset (but we will engineer this for scale so we will assume all countries could potentially be in the dataset)
- Simple, flat structure optimized for performance
- Consistent numeric medal counts
- Standard country codes for internationalization support

## API Architecture Principles

### 1. Read-Only Operations

- **GET requests only** - No data mutations required for this dashboard
- Stateless API design for optimal caching and scalability
- Idempotent operations that can be safely retried

### 2. Strong TypeScript Integration

- Comprehensive type definitions for all request/response payloads
- Type-safe query parameters and response formatting

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Database-optimized queries** with proper indexing for global scale (195+ countries)
- **API-level sorting** with database-level ORDER BY clauses
- **Efficient pagination** for large result sets

### 4. Atomic Updates Pattern

- **Consistent data snapshots** - All related calculations computed together
- **Race condition prevention** - Ensure sorting operations complete atomically
- **Transactional data processing** - Prevent partial computations from being served

## Specification Requirements

### URL Parameter Requirements

- **Single parameter**: `sort` - determines the type of medals to sort by
- **Valid values**: `'total'`, `'gold'`, `'silver'`, `'bronze'`
- **Default behavior**: If no sort parameter is passed, default sort is `'gold'`

### Sort Ranking & Tie-Breaking Rules

As per specification, all sorting is **descending** (highest first) with specific tie-breaking rules:

1. **When ranking by total medals**: Ties are broken by most gold
2. **When ranking by gold**: Ties are broken by most silver  
3. **When ranking by silver**: Ties are broken by most gold
4. **When ranking by bronze**: Ties are broken by most gold

### Example API Calls

```text
GET /api/medals                    // Default: sorted by gold medals
GET /api/medals?sort=total         // Sorted by total medals (ties broken by gold)
GET /api/medals?sort=silver        // Sorted by silver medals (ties broken by gold)
GET /api/medals?sort=bronze        // Sorted by bronze medals (ties broken by gold)
```

## API Endpoints Design

### Core Endpoint

#### `GET /api/medals`

**Purpose**: Retrieve all medal data with optional sorting

```typescript
interface MedalsRequest {
  sort?: 'total' | 'gold' | 'silver' | 'bronze';  // Default: 'gold'
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
}

interface MedalsResponse {
  data: MedalCountryWithTotal[];
  meta: {
    total: number;
    sort: string;
    timestamp: string;
  };
}

interface MedalCountryWithTotal extends MedalCountry {
  total: number;        // Computed: gold + silver + bronze
  rank?: number;        // Computed based on sort criteria
}
```

## Performance Implementation Strategy

### 1. Data Processing

Create a simple data processing utility that:

- Loads medal data from JSON file (easily replaceable with database calls)
- Calculates derived fields like totals and rankings
- Handles the specification's tie-breaking rules consistently

### 2. API Design for Scale

Structure the API to handle growth gracefully:

- Single `/api/medals` endpoint with clear parameter structure
- Consistent response format with pagination metadata
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- TypeScript interfaces that can evolve with requirements

### 3. Basic Performance Considerations

Simple optimizations that matter at scale:

- Calculate totals and rankings server-side rather than client-side
- Use appropriate HTTP cache headers for static data
- Structure responses to be easily cacheable by CDNs

### 4. Database-Ready Architecture

Design with future database migration in mind:

- API interfaces that work whether data comes from JSON or database
- Query patterns that translate well to SQL ORDER BY clauses
- Parameter structure that maps to database indexes
- Response format that supports database pagination patterns in the future

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Processing âœ…

- [x] `medals.json` data structure established
- [ ] Build basic data processing utility
- [ ] Implement TypeScript interfaces for requests/responses
- [ ] Add proper sorting logic with tie-breaking

### Phase 2: Basic API Implementation

- [ ] Create `/api/medals` endpoint with sorting
- [ ] Add basic parameter validation
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add basic response caching

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features

- [ ] Ensure compatibiltiy with future pagination support for larger datasets
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish

- [ ] Unit tests for sorting logic
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints

## Performance Targets

### Response Time Goals

- **API responses**: < 100ms for typical requests
- **Large datasets**: < 500ms for all countries with pagination
- **Consistent performance**: Predictable response times regardless of sort order

## Error Handling Strategy

Simple, effective error handling:

- Proper HTTP status codes (400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors)
- Clear error messages that help with debugging
- Graceful fallbacks when data is unavailable
- Consistent error response format

## Scalability Architecture (Built-In)

### Database Migration Path

- **Current**: JSON file approach works for small datasets
- **Future**: Easy migration to PostgreSQL or similar database
- **Index Strategy**: Primary key on country code, indexes on medal counts for sorting
- **API Stability**: Same endpoint and response format regardless of data source

### Advanced Features we could add later

- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket support for live medal updates
- **GraphQL layer**: More flexible query capabilities
- **Multi-language support**: Localized country names
- **Historical data**: Time-series medal progression

This API plan establishes a robust foundation for serving Olympic medal data with optimal performance, type safety, 
and consistency guarantees while remaining simple and maintainable.
