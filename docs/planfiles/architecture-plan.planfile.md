# Architecture Plan: Olympic Medals Dashboard

## Objective

Build a scalable, maintainable Olympic medals dashboard application that displays medal data through a clean, accessible
interface. The application will demonstrate best practices in component-driven development while being built for scale.

## Completed Boilerplate Work

Based on the established ADRs, we have already made the following architectural decisions:

### ✅ Framework & Language Stack

- **Next.js** as the React framework (ADR 002)
  - Provides SSR/SSG capabilities, built-in routing, and performance optimisations
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - API routes for backend functionality
- **TypeScript** for type safety (ADR 003)
  - Compile-time error detection
  - Enhanced developer experience with better IDE support
  - Self-documenting code through type annotations

### ✅ Styling & UI

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (ADR 004)
  - Utility-first approach for rapid development
  - Built-in design system with consistent spacing and typography
  - Excellent performance through automatic purging of unused styles

### ✅ Development & Testing

- **Storybook** for component development (ADR 005)
  - Component isolation and living documentation
  - Visual regression testing capabilities
  - Storybook-driven development workflow

### ✅ Documentation

- **ADRs** for architectural decisions (ADR 001)
  - Single source of truth for architectural decisions
  - Audit trail for decisions and reasoning

## Application Architecture

### Core Principles

#### 1. Component-Driven Development (Storybook-Driven)

- All UI components will be developed in isolation using Storybook
- Components must have corresponding `.stories.tsx` files with interaction tests
- Living documentation through Storybook's auto-generated docs

#### 2. Consistent State Management

- **State consistency**: Keep related UI state synchronized (filters, sort order, displayed data)
- **Predictable updates**: State changes happen in a predictable, debuggable way
- **Data integrity**: Ensure UI state matches the current data and user selections
- **Smooth user experience**: Prevent jarring UI changes and loading states

#### 3. SOLID Principles

- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Components open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Component variants must be interchangeable
- **I**nterface Segregation: Props interfaces focused and minimal
- **D**ependency Inversion: Components depend on abstractions, not concretions

#### 4. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Shared utilities in `/src/utils`
- Common types in `/src/types`
- Reusable hooks in `/src/hooks`
- Consistent design tokens through Tailwind configuration

```

## Data Architecture

### API Structure

Based on the API development planning, we'll have a single endpoint:

```typescript
// GET /api/v1/medals?sort=gold|silver|bronze|total
interface MedalCountry {
  code: string;        // ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes
  gold: number;        // Gold medal count
  silver: number;      // Silver medal count
  bronze: number;      // Bronze medal count
  total: number;       // Computed total (gold + silver + bronze)
  rank: number;        // Position in current sort order
}

interface MedalsResponse {
  data: MedalCountry[];
  meta: {
    totalCountries: number;
    sortType: string;
    timestamp: string;
  };
}
```

**Key API Features:**

- Single sort parameter with tie-breaking rules (as per specification)
- Server-side calculation of totals and rankings
- Built for database migration (though starting with JSON)
- TypeScript interfaces that can evolve with requirements

### State Management Strategy

Keep it simple and scalable:

- **Local component state** for UI-only behaviour (modals, dropdowns, form inputs)
- **Server state** from `/api/v1/medals` endpoint (easily cached)
- **URL state** for sort parameter (shareable links, browser history)
- **Minimal client state** - avoid complex state management unless truly needed

## Component Design Patterns

### 1. Component Interface Design

```typescript
// Consistent prop naming and structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Data props (what to display)
  data?: ComponentData;
  
  // Appearance props (how to display)
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  
  // Behaviour props (what to do)
  onAction?: (data: ActionData) => void;
  
  // Standard props
  className?: string;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
  'data-testid'?: string;
}
```

### 2. Component Composition

- Favour composition over inheritance
- Use compound components for complex UI patterns
- Implement render props for flexible data presentation

### 3. Accessibility First

- All interactive components must have proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Colour contrast compliance

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements

Realistic targets for demonstrating scalable thinking:

- **Page load time**: Under 2 seconds on typical connections
- **API responses**: Under 100ms for sorting operations
- **Bundle optimization**: Code splitting for non-critical components
- **Image optimization**: Efficient country flag loading
- **Scalable sorting**: Server-side processing ready for larger datasets

### Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive design
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Accessibility Standards

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation

## Future Considerations

### Scalability Architecture

The application is designed to handle growth gracefully:

- **Database-ready API**: Easy migration from JSON to PostgreSQL
- **Component-driven development**: Reusable components that scale
- **Server-side processing**: Efficient handling of larger datasets
- **Consistent interfaces**: API design that remains stable as data sources change

### Future Feature Extensions

- **Real-time updates**: Live medal count updates during events
- **Historical data**: Medal progression over multiple Olympics
- **Enhanced visualizations**: Charts and graphs for medal trends
- **Athlete profiles**: Detailed athlete information and achievements
- **Export functionality**: CSV/PDF export of medal data
- **Multi-language support**: Localized country names and interfaces

## Key Architectural Lessons

Based on the API development planning process, this architecture emphasizes:

1. **Practical scalability** - Building for growth without over-engineering the current solution  
2. **Simple, effective patterns** - Clear separation of concerns without complex abstractions
3. **Database-ready design** - Architecture that works for both JSON files and future database integration
4. **Component-driven development** - Storybook-first approach for maintainable, testable components
5. **Performance through simplicity** - Server-side processing and efficient data structures

This architecture plan establishes a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable Olympic medals dashboard while 
balancing best practices with practical implementation needs.
