# Architecture Plan: Olympic Medals Dashboard

## Objective

Build a scalable, maintainable Olympic medals dashboard application that displays medal data through a clean, accessible interface. The application will demonstrate best practices in component-driven development while being built for scale.

## Completed Boilerplate Work

Based on the established ADRs, we have already made the following architectural decisions:

### ✅ Framework & Language Stack

- **Next.js** as the React framework (ADR 002)
  - Provides SSR/SSG capabilities, built-in routing, and performance optimisations
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - API routes for backend functionality
- **TypeScript** for type safety (ADR 003)
  - Compile-time error detection
  - Enhanced developer experience with better IDE support
  - Self-documenting code through type annotations

### ✅ Styling & UI

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (ADR 004)
  - Utility-first approach for rapid development
  - Built-in design system with consistent spacing and typography
  - Excellent performance through automatic purging of unused styles

### ✅ Development & Testing

- **Storybook** for component development (ADR 005)
  - Component isolation and living documentation
  - Visual regression testing capabilities
  - Storybook-driven development workflow

### ✅ Documentation

- **ADRs** for architectural decisions (ADR 001)
  - Single source of truth for architectural decisions
  - Audit trail for decisions and reasoning

## Application Architecture

### Core Principles

#### 1. Component-Driven Development (Storybook-Driven)

- All UI components will be developed in isolation using Storybook
- Components must have corresponding `.stories.tsx` files with interaction tests
- Living documentation through Storybook's auto-generated docs

#### 2. Atomic Updates

- **State consistency**: All related state changes happen together as a single update
- **UI consistency**: Prevent intermediate states from being rendered during updates
- **Data integrity**: Ensure medal data, filters, and UI state remain in sync
- **Race condition prevention**: Avoid partial updates that could lead to inconsistent application state
- **Transactional updates**: Batch related changes to prevent flickering or partial renders

#### 3. SOLID Principles

- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Components open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Component variants must be interchangeable
- **I**nterface Segregation: Props interfaces focused and minimal
- **D**ependency Inversion: Components depend on abstractions, not concretions

#### 4. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Shared utilities in `/src/utils`
- Common types in `/src/types`
- Reusable hooks in `/src/hooks`
- Consistent design tokens through Tailwind configuration

```

## Data Architecture

### API Structure

```typescript
// GET /api/medals
interface MedalData {
  id: string;
  country: string;
  countryCode: string;
  sport: string;
  event: string;
  medalType: 'gold' | 'silver' | 'bronze';
  athlete: string;
  year: number;
  games: 'summer' | 'winter';
}

// GET /api/medals/summary
interface MedalSummary {
  country: string;
  countryCode: string;
  gold: number;
  silver: number;
  bronze: number;
  total: number;
}
```

### State Management Strategy

- **Local component state** for UI-only behaviour (modals, dropdowns)
- **Server state** managed through Next.js API routes and SWR/React Query
- **URL state** for filters and search parameters (Next.js router)
- **Client state** minimised, only for cross-component UI state

## Component Design Patterns

### 1. Component Interface Design

```typescript
// Consistent prop naming and structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Data props (what to display)
  data?: ComponentData;
  
  // Appearance props (how to display)
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  
  // Behaviour props (what to do)
  onAction?: (data: ActionData) => void;
  
  // Standard props
  className?: string;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
  'data-testid'?: string;
}
```

### 2. Component Composition

- Favour composition over inheritance
- Use compound components for complex UI patterns
- Implement render props for flexible data presentation

### 3. Accessibility First

- All interactive components must have proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Colour contrast compliance
